### Description

With this website I sought to show the projects I'll be working during the bootcamp.

### Modifications

* Changed value "title" to "Jesica Paez // Web Developer".

* Organized the HTML file adding <div class> to separate the sections

* Created a .root{} element to be able to more easily handle changing the color of the text and backgroudn of the different sections.

* Applied margin and padding values to the different sections of the page to make them similar to the portfolio example.

* Created a README.md file

### Links

* Link to my portfolio [Jesica Paez Portfolio](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html)
